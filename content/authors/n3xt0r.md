I am a software engineer with more than 15 years of experience in backend development, system architecture, and DevOps.  
I enjoy designing clean, modular applications and improving developer workflows through automation, CI/CD, and security best practices.

My professional background includes working with PHP ecosystems such as Laravel, Laminas, and Symfony, as well as designing and maintaining APIs, refactoring legacy systems, and leading technical initiatives to improve maintainability and scalability.

I am also certified as an Information Security Officer (ISO 27001), which allows me to combine development expertise with a strong focus on security and compliance.  
I am passionate about knowledge sharing, open-source contributions, and exploring new ways to make complex systems more reliable and developer-friendly.
